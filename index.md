# Welcome to My Page!

Hello, my name is Parker Moesta and I'm currently finishing up my M.Sc in Data Science at the University of Michigan - School of Information. I have a diverse educational background, starting with an undergraduate degree in Economics. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a keen interest in consumer sentiment, specifically in relation to greenwash advertising. This interest led me to undertake research in this area, providing me with my first taste of data analysis.

I then decided to deepen my understanding of analytics by pursuing an M.Sc in Business Analytics. Here, I delved into the world of discrete event simulation, which culminated in a research paper that was presented at the 4th North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management (IEOM).

Now, as I near the completion of my second master's degree, I have developed a robust set of skills in data science. I am excited to use these skills to tackle complex problems and generate insights from data.

Apart from my academic and professional interests, I am an avid backpacker, skier, and rock climber. These activities provide a balance to my life, allowing me to unwind and recharge. I believe that this balance is essential in maintaining creativity and enthusiasm in my work.

On this site, you'll find a collection of my projects and blog posts that demonstrate my skills and interests in data science. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat!
