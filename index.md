# Welcome to My Page!

Hello! I'm Parker Moesta.

I'm an Data Scientist and AI enthusiast currently wrapping up my M.Sc in Data Science at the University of Michigan - School of Information. My journey began with an undergraduate degree in Economics where I delved into research around consumer sentiment, specifically around greenwash advertising and the downstream effects that had on shareholder value. During these years is where I laid my foundation in mathematics, statistics, and research.

In pursuit of a deeper understanding of analytics, I embarked on an M.Sc in Business Analytics. This academic endeavor facilitated my immersion into advanced statistics, optimization techniques, and simulation theory, marking my initiation into the multifaceted realm of Data Science. The zenith of this scholarly phase was my exploration of discrete event simulation, which culminated in a research paper that I presented at the esteemed 4th North American IEOM Conference

But what really drives me? It's the magic behind building deep learning models. I find it incredibly fulfilling to construct complex architectures from scratch. There's something beautiful about the mathematical intricacies woven into these models. This fascination keeps me on my toes, continuously learning and staying abreast of the latest research.

When I'm not tinkering with models or poring over the latest AI research, you'll find me backpacking, skiing, or rock climbing. These activities offer a well-needed balance, igniting creativity and passion in my work.

On this page, you'll find a collection of my projects and musings, each reflecting my skills and interests in data science and AI. So, feel free to explore! If you have any questions or just fancy a chat about the wonderful world of AI, don't hesitate to reach out!
