# Welcome to My Page!

Hello, my name is Parker Moesta. I'm a data science enthusiast currently wrapping up my M.Sc in Data Science at the University of Michigan - School of Information. My academic journey began with an undergraduate degree in Economics, where I developed a keen interest in consumer sentiment, specifically in relation to greenwash advertising. This interest sparked my first foray into data analysis and research.

To deepen my understanding of analytics, I pursued an M.Sc in Business Analytics. This journey led me to the world of discrete event simulation and resulted in a research paper presented at the 4th North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management (IEOM).

Recently, my passion has been focused on building complex and challenging deep learning models, particularly those involving Generative models. I find great satisfaction in delving into the mathematical intricacies and implementation details of different architectures, as it allows me to fully understand and optimize these powerful tools.

Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I am an avid backpacker, skier, and rock climber. These activities provide a balance to my life, fostering creativity and enthusiasm in my work.

On this site, you'll find a collection of my projects and blog posts that demonstrate my skills and interests in data science. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat!
